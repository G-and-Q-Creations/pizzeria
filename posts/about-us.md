## About Us
Goeun and Quigley are two Millenials from the Midwest with absolutely no right to publicly declare their lukewarm pizza opinions around town. (Dead serious, we used to smear Ranch dressing and Velveeta on pies as teenagers.) Unfortunately, we know how to put a website on the Internet. 

Goeun loves anchovies and hates pineapples on pizza.

Quigley loves pineapples and hates anchovies on pizza.
